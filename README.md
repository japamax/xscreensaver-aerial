# xscreensaver-aerial for Cinnamon
An xscreensaver that randomly selects one of the Apple TV4 HD aerial movies and plays it using mpv. 
* The day movies will play between the hours of 7 AM and 7 PM while the night movies will play thereafter.
* No movie should repeat until all of the respective movies have cycled through once. After that, the queue will reset and continue playing in a random fashion.
* No excessive HDD usage. When the display is told to sleep by xscreensaver, whatever video is currently playing will finish and another will NOT get called until the display is active again.

# Dependencies
* coreutils
* mpv
* xscreensaver

# Installation
## Users of Arch Linux
Arch Linux users  need only clone and build this repository and add videos by installing from the AUR (below).

```
git clone https://github.com/japamax/xscreensaver-aerial-cinnamon.git
cd xscreensaver-aerial
makepkg -i
```

## Arch Linux Packages
* https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xscreensaver-aerial-videos (optional to avoid bandwidth of streaming from apple)

## Users of other distros
Users of other distros can manually complete these 2 steps:

1) Copy `atv4.sh` from this repo  to `/usr/lib/xscreensaver/atv4` and make it executable by running the following as the root user:
```
cp atv4.sh /usr/lib/xscreensaver/atv4 && chmod 755 /usr/lib/xscreensaver/atv4
```

2) Copy `atv4.xml` from this repo  to `/usr/share/xscreensaver/config` and make it readable by running the following as the root user:
```
cp atv4.xml /usr/share/xscreensaver/config/atv4.xml && chmod 644 /usr/share/xscreensaver/config/atv4.xml
```

3) Optionally download the expected video content manually to save the bandwidth of repeatedly streaming them.
This screensaver expects them to be installed to `/opt/ATV4` which should be world-readable. You may use the following to little script to obtain the videos and save them to this location. Make sure that you have `wget` installed prior to running the script:
```
#!/bin/sh
# run this from /opt/ATV4 which you created and assigned 755 premissions manually
